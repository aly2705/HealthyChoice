                <h2 id="sub1">About micronutrients</h2>
                <p>Micronutrients are one of the major groups of nutrients your body needs. They include vitamins and minerals.</p>
                <p>Vitamins are necessary for energy production, immune function, blood clotting and other functions. Meanwhile, minerals play an important role in growth, bone health, fluid balance and several other processes.</p>
                <p>The term micronutrients is used to describe vitamins and minerals in general.
                Macronutrients, on the other hand, include <a class="macroRef" href="Proteins.html">proteins</a>, <a class="macroRef" href="Fats.html">fats</a> and <a class="macroRef" href="Carbs.html">carbohydrates.</a>
                Your body needs smaller amounts of micronutrients relative to macronutrients. That’s why they’re labeled “micro.”</p>
                <p>Humans must obtain micronutrients from food since your body cannot produce vitamins and minerals — for the most part. That’s why they’re also referred to as essential nutrients.</p>
                <p>Vitamins are organic compounds made by plants and animals which can be broken down by heat, acid or air. On the other hand, minerals are inorganic, exist in soil or water and cannot be broken down. </p>
                <p>When you eat, you consume the vitamins that plants and animals created or the minerals they absorbed. The micronutrient content of each food is different, so it’s best to eat a variety of foods to get enough vitamins and minerals.</p>
                <p>An adequate intake of all micronutrients is necessary for optimal health, as each vitamin and mineral has a specific role in your body. Vitamins and minerals are vital for growth, immune function, brain development and many other important functionsDepending on their function, certain micronutrients also play a role in preventing and fighting disease </p>
            
                <h2 id="sub2">Types and Functions of Micronutrients</h2>
                <p>Vitamins and minerals can be divided into four categories: water-soluble vitamins, fat-soluble vitamins, macrominerals and trace minerals.
                Regardless of type, vitamins and minerals are absorbed in similar ways in your body and interact in many processes.</p>
            
                <h3 id="sub21">Water-Soluble Vitamins</h3>
                <p>Most vitamins dissolve in water and are therefore known as water-soluble. They’re not easily stored in your body and get flushed out with urine when consumed in excess. </p>
                <p>While each <a target="_break" href="https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/water-soluble-vitamins">water-soluble vitamin</a> has a unique role, their functions are related. </p>
                <p>For example, most B vitamins act as coenzymes that help trigger important chemical reactions. A lot of these reactions are necessary for energy production.</p>
                <p>The water-soluble vitamins — with some of their functions — are:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="advice">Vitamin B1 (thiamine):</span>Helps convert nutrients into energy </li>
                    <li><span class="advice">Vitamin B2 (riboflavin):</span>Necessary for energy production, cell function and fat metabolism </li>
                    <li><span class="advice">Vitamin B3 (niacin):</span>Drives the production of energy from food</li>
                    <li><span class="advice">Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid):</span>Necessary for fatty acid synthesis </li>
                    <li><span class="advice">Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine):</span>Helps your body release sugar from stored carbohydrates for energy and create red blood cells</li>
                    <li><span class="advice">Vitamin B7 (biotin):</span>Plays a role in the metabolism of fatty acids, amino acids and glucose</li>
                    <li><span class="advice">Vitamin B9 (folate):</span>Important for proper cell division</li>
                    <li><span class="advice">Vitamin B12 (cobalamin):</span>Necessary for red blood cell formation and proper nervous system and brain function</li>
                    <li><span class="advice">Vitamin C (ascorbic acid):</span>Required for the creation of neurotransmitters and collagen, the main protein in your skin</li>    
                </ul>
                <p>As you can see, water-soluble vitamins play an important role in producing energy but also have several other functions.
                Since these vitamins are not stored in your body, it’s important to get enough of them from food.</p>
