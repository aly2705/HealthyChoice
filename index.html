    <h2>About the human nutrition</h2>
    <p>Human nutrition deals with the provision of essential nutrients in food that are necessary to
        support human life and good health. 
        <br>Poor nutrition is a chronic problem often linked to poverty, 
        food security or a poor understanding of nutrition and dietary practices and poor knowledge about
        nutrients required by the body at various stages of life to prevent deficiency of nutrients in body 
        which can have adverse effects on body.
        <br>Malnutrition and its consequences are large contributors to
        deaths, physical deformities and disabilities worldwide. Good nutrition is necessary for children to 
        grow physically and mentally, and for normal human biological development.
    </p>
    
    <h2>About nutrients</h2>
    <p>
        The seven major classes of nutrients are carbohydrates, fats, fiber, minerals, proteins, vitamins, and water.
        <br>
        Nutrients can be grouped as either macronutrients or micronutrients (needed in small quantities). Carbohydrates,
        fats, and proteins are macronutrients, and provide energy. Water and fiber are macronutrients but do not provide energy.
        The micronutrients are minerals and vitamins. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The macronutrients (excluding fiber and water) provide structural material (amino acids from which proteins are built,
        and lipids from which cell membranes and some signaling molecules are built), and energy. Some of the structural material
        can also be used to generate energy internally, and in either case it is measured in Joules or kilocalories 
        (often called "Calories" and written with a capital 'C' to distinguish them from little 'c' calories). 
        <br>
        Carbohydrates and proteins provide 17 kJ approximately (4 kcal) of energy per gram, while fats provide 37 kJ (9 kcal) per gram, 
        though the net energy from either depends on such factors as absorption and digestive effort, which vary substantially from instance to instance.
        <br>
        Vitamins, minerals, fiber, and water do not provide energy, but are required for other reasons. A third class of dietary material,
        fiber (i.e., nondigestible material such as cellulose), seems also to be required, for both mechanical and biochemical reasons, 
        though the exact reasons remain unclear. For all age groups, males on average need to consume higher amounts of macronutrients than females.
        In general, intakes increase with age until the second or third decade of life.
    </p>

    <p>
        Some nutrients can be stored - the fat-soluble vitamins - while others are required more or less continuously. 
        Poor health can be caused by a lack of required nutrients, or for some vitamins and minerals, too much of a required nutrient.
        Essential nutrients cannot be synthesized by the body, and must be obtained from food.
        <br>
        Molecules of carbohydrates and fats consist of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms. Carbohydrates range from simple monosaccharides
        (glucose, fructose, galactose) to complex polysaccharides (starch). Fats are triglycerides, made of assorted fatty acid monomers bound
        to a glycerol backbone. Some fatty acids, but not all, are essential in the diet: they cannot be synthesized in the body.
        Protein molecules contain nitrogen atoms in addition to carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen. The fundamental components of protein
        are nitrogen-containing amino acids, some of which are essential in the sense that humans cannot make them internally. 
        Some of the amino acids are convertible (with the expenditure of energy) to glucose and can be used for energy production just as ordinary glucose,
        in a process known as gluconeogenesis. By breaking down existing protein, some glucose can be produced internally; the remaining amino acids are discarded,
        primarily as urea in urine. This occurs naturally when atrophy takes place, or during periods of starvation.
        <br>
        The list of nutrients that people are known to require is, in the words of Marion Nestle, "almost certainly incomplete".
