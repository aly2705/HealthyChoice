            <div id="main">
                <h2 id="sub1">What are dietary fats?</h2>
                <p>Fat is a type of nutrient, and just like protein and carbohydrates, your body needs some fat for energy, to absorb vitamins, and to protect your heart and brain health. For years we’ve been told that eating fat will add inches to your waistline, raise cholesterol, and cause a myriad of health problems. But now we know that not all fat is the same.</p>
                <p>“Bad” fats, such as artificial trans fats and saturated fats, are guilty of the unhealthy things all fats have been blamed for—weight gain, clogged arteries, an increased risk of certain diseases, and so forth. But “good” fats such as unsaturated fats and omega-3 fatty acids have the opposite effect. In fact, healthy fats play a huge role in helping you manage your moods, stay on top of your mental game, fight fatigue, and even control your weight.</p>
                <p>By understanding the difference between good and bad fats and how to include more healthy fat in your diet, you can improve how well you think and feel, boost your energy, and even trim your waistline.</p>
            
                <h2 id="sub2">Dietary fat and cholesterol</h2>
                <p>Dietary fat plays a major role in your cholesterol levels. Cholesterol is a fatty, wax-like substance that your body needs to function properly. In and of itself, cholesterol isn’t bad. But when you get too much of it, it can have a negative impact on your health. As with dietary fat, there are good and bad types of cholesterol.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>HDL cholesterol is the “good” kind of cholesterol found in your blood.</li>
                    <li>LDL cholesterol is the “bad” kind.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The key is to keep LDL levels low and HDL high, which may protect against heart disease and stroke.
                Conversely, high levels of LDL cholesterol can clog arteries and low HDL can be a marker for increased cardiovascular risk.</p>
                <p>Rather than the amount of cholesterol you eat, the biggest influence on your cholesterol levels is the type of fats you consume. So instead of counting cholesterol, it’s important to focus on replacing bad fats with good fats.</p>
            
                <h2 id="sub3">Good fats vs. bad fats</h2>
                <p>Since fat is an important part of a healthy diet, rather than adopting a low-fat diet, it’s more important to focus on eating more beneficial “good” fats and limiting harmful “bad” fats.</p>
                <h3>Healthy or “good” fats</h3>
                <p>Monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats are known as the “good fats” because they are good for your heart, your cholesterol, and your overall health.Adding more of these healthy fats to your diet may also help to make you feel more satisfied after a meal, reducing hunger and thus promoting weight loss</p>
                <p><strong>Monounsaturated fat</strong> – good sources include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Olive, canola, peanut, and sesame oils</li>
                    <li>Avocados</li>
                    <li>Olives</li>
                    <li>Nuts (almonds, peanuts, macadamia, hazelnuts, pecans, cashews)</li>
                    <li>Peanut butter</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Polyunsaturated fat</strong> – good sources include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sunflower, sesame, and pumpkin seeds</li>
                    <li>Flaxseed</li>
                    <li>Walnuts</li>
                    <li>Fatty fish (salmon, tuna, mackerel, herring, trout, sardines) and fish oil</li>
                    <li>Soybean and safflower oil</li>
                    <li>Soymilk</li>
                    <li>Tofu</li>    
                </ul>
                <h3>Unhealthy or “bad” fats</h3>
                <p><strong>Trans fat.</strong> Small amounts of naturally occurring trans fats can be found in meat and dairy products but it’s artificial trans fats that are considered dangerous. This is the worst type of fat since it not only raises bad LDL cholesterol but also lowers good HDL levels. Artificial trans fats can also create inflammation, which is linked to heart disease, stroke, and other chronic conditions and contributes to insulin resistance, which increases your risk of developing Type 2 diabetes.</p>
                <p>In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has effectively outlawed the use of artificial trans-fats in commercially prepared food and the World Health Organization (WHO) has called on other governments around the world to eliminate the use of trans fats by 2023. However, products made before the FDA ban may still be available for sale. Since products can be listed as having “zero trans fats” even if they contain up to 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving, it’s still important to carefully read food labels. Look for ingredients referred to as “partially hydrogenated oils.” These hidden sources of artificial trans fats can add up quickly.</p>
                <p>If your country still allows the use of artificial trans fats, remember that no amount is considered safe, so aim to eliminate it from your diet.</p>
                <p><strong>Trans fat</strong> – primary sources include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Commercially-baked pastries, cookies, doughnuts, muffins, cakes, pizza dough</li>
                    <li>Packaged snack foods (crackers, microwave popcorn, chips)</li>
                    <li>Stick margarine, vegetable shortening</li>
                    <li>Fried foods (French fries, fried chicken, chicken nuggets, breaded fish)</li>
                    <li>Anything containing hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil, even if it claims to be “trans fat-free”</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Saturated fat.</strong> While not as harmful as trans fat, saturated fat can raise bad LDL cholesterol and too much can negatively impact heart health, so it’s best consumed in moderation. While there’s <em>no need to cut out all</em> saturated fat from your diet, most nutrition experts recommend limiting it to 10% of your daily calories.</p>
                <p><strong>Saturated fat</strong> – primary sources include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Red meat (beef, lamb, pork)</li>
                    <li>Chicken skin</li>
                    <li>Whole-fat dairy products (milk, cream, cheese)</li>
                    <li>Butter</li>
                    <li>Ice cream</li>
                    <li>Lard</li>
                    <li>Tropical oils such as coconut and palm oil</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 id="sub4">Tips for adding more healthy fats to your diet</h2>
                <p>Instead of obsessively counting fat grams, aim for a diet rich in a variety of vegetables, fruit, nuts, and beans, with two or more weekly servings of fatty fish, moderate amounts of dairy, small amounts of red meat, and only occasional fried or processed meals.</p>
                <p>This might mean replacing fried chicken with grilled chicken, swapping out some of the red meat you eat with other sources of protein such as fish, chicken, or beans, or using olive oil rather than butter. Following a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.helpguide.org/articles/diets/the-mediterranean-diet.htm">Mediterranean diet</a> can also help ensure you’re getting enough good fats in your diet and limiting the bad ones.</p>
                <p><span class="advice">Limit your intake of saturated fats</span> by replacing some of the red meat you eat with beans, nuts, poultry, and fish, and switching from whole milk dairy to lower fat versions. But don’t make the mistake of replacing saturated fat with refined carbohydrates and sugary foods.</p>
                <p><span class="advice">Eat omega-3 fats every day.</span>Include a variety of fish sources as well as plant sources such as walnuts, ground flax seeds, flaxseed oil, canola oil, and soybean oil.</p>
                <p><span class="advice">Cook with olive oil.</span>Use olive oil for stovetop cooking rather than butter, stick margarine, or lard. For baking, try canola oil.</p>
                <p><span class="advice">Eat more avocados.</span>Try them in sandwiches or salads or make guacamole. Along with being loaded with heart- and brain-healthy fats, they make for a filling meal.</p>
                <p><span class="advice">Reach for the nuts.</span>You can add nuts to vegetable dishes, use them instead of breadcrumbs on chicken or fish, or make your own trail mix with nuts, seeds, and dried fruit.</p>
                <p><span class="advice">Snack on olives.</span>Olives are high in healthy monounsaturated fats and make for a low-calorie snack. Try them plain or make a tapenade for dipping.</p>
                <p><span class="advice">Dress your own salad.</span>Commercial salad dressings are often high in unhealthy fat or added sugars. Create your own healthy dressings with olive, flaxseed, or sesame oils.</p>
